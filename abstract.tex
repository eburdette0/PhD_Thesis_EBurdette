\section*{Abstract}
    This thesis details advances in experimental deformation methods applied to investigate the creep behavior of antigorite serpentinite. This hydrous mineral is present in downgoing slabs and nearby mantle, possibly initiating intermediate depth earthquakes and controlling slab-mantle rheological coupling. The stick-slip (earthquake-like) behavior of antigorite has not been demonstrated at pressures where it is common in the earth. The first chapter of this thesis is an investigation of the relevance of stored energy (machine stiffness) to antigorite weakening during dehydration at 1 GPa confining pressure which produces shear heating. The third chapter outlines methods for calculating stiffness in typical deformation geometry and the effects typical experimental choices like the amount of viscous resistance may have on experimental fault compliance. Appendix A details a loading path that was able to generate stick-slip in dehydrating antigorite. The unusual sheet structure and mesh texture of antigorite requires high pressure, limited temperature, and long times to accurately measure its rheology in the earth. The second chapter of this thesis demonstrates methods and results of antigorite deformation under constant stress creep conditions in a Griggs-type apparatus at 1 GPa confining pressure. The recovered microstructure indicates basal sliding limited by kinking of antigorite grains. The fourth chapter of this thesis describes a sensor built primarily to measure internal load during high pressure creep experiments. Appendix B describes preliminary experiments deforming confined olivine with free surfaces.
