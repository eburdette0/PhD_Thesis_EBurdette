\subsection{Mechanical Data Calculations} \label{CH2s_mechcalcs}
    The Griggs apparatus has both external load and displacement sensors which need to be corrected to find load and displacement on the sample inside the pressure vessel. Differential stress is determined by subtracting a "hit point" stress (hydrostatic pressure+friction) from the externally measured load. Displacement is determined by subtracting displacement absorbed by the column in compression \citep{burdette2020enhanced}, and referenced relative to the "hit point".
    \begin{equation}
        x_{sample} = x_{LVDT2} - \frac{\sigma_{1, external}}{k_{lower/_column}}
    \end{equation}
    To calculate permanent/inelastic strain, elastic compression of the sample can also be removed:   
    \begin{equation}
        k_{sample} = \frac{E}{l_{sample}}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        x_{inelastic} = x_{LVDT2} - \frac{\sigma_{1, external}}{k_{lower\_column}} - \frac{\sigma_{differential, internal}}{k_{sample}}
    \end{equation}
    
    Note that these equations assume sample elasticity is constant, and don't account for rate-dependent friction.
    
    To calculate strain rates during post-processing, we used the first derivative of a first order Savitzky-Golay filter (moving line fit) over a moving time window chosen for each step. For strain rates above $10^{-6} 1/s$, the window could be as short as 100 seconds, while the lowest strain rates require a 10000 second time window. Strain rates chosen for flow law fits were the final point that was not influenced by a disturbance or loading to the next stress. Wherever strain rate is plotted as a continuous function of time (e.g. figure \ref{fig:CH2s_Load-Displacement}), a single window length was chosen over the whole plot to best display data.

\subsection{Hardening During Stress Steps} \label{CH2s_hardening_discussion}

    During individual stress steps samples harden over time (S\ref{fig:CH2s_Load-Time-Fast}). Hardening is expected to some extent from other descriptions/results of brittle creep and high temperature creep tests where primary, secondary, and tertiary creep phases can be identified. For westerly granite calibration tests (S\ref{fig:CH2s_Westerly_Supplement}), at each step samples reach constant strain rates after relatively small strains (~0.2\%). Post-processing of antigorite data shows that it may continue to harden over similar 0.2\% strain steps (depicted in data for W2447-200 (S\ref{fig:CH2s_Load-Time-Fast})). This decay is not obvious in live displays of data because it requires more processing power to smooth and compute than our rig control PC has available. 
    
    The observed rate decay appears to be linear when plotted as either log(strain rate) vs. strain (\ref{fig:CH2s_Strainrate-Strain}) and log(strain rate) vs. time (\ref{fig:CH2s_Strainrate-Time}). The strain rate decreases by approximately a factor of 2 over 0.2\% strain as can be observed in the included strain-time plots for W2447-200 (\ref{fig:CH2s_Load-Time-Fast}), and the decay during hydraulic oil confined experiment W2521-75 (\ref{fig:CH2s_Strainrate-Strain}). (Data is FIR decimated by a factor of 100 to 0.1Hz for these plots).

\subsection{Uncertainty introduced due to hardening} \label{CH2s_hardening_uncertainty}
    The ratio of initial/final strain seems to be similar at most stress steps. This makes ratio/increment (hardening slope) much larger at small strain. Hardening literature plots the change as $d\sigma/d\epsilon$ vs. $\sigma$ \citep{kocks2003physics}. It's unclear if that's appropriate for materials with pressure-dependent strength. 
    
    To assess the potential uncertainty introduced into the flow law by choosing final instead of initial strain rates, we re-plotted the fit for initial strain rates. Because change is a similar factor of ~2 for most steps, the fit exponent and athermal flow  stresses don’t change significantly while pre-exponential and activation energy change by ~5\%. % An example with the same exponents and peierls stress is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:CH2s_Hardening_Uncertainty}.

    In addition, our creep data can be compared to other antigorite deformation studies at similar temperatures and pressures \ref{fig:CH2s_Data_Comparison_supplement}. Some of the comparable studies use antigorite gouge instead of cores, which is noted. Despite widely varying methodology, recorded stress/strainrate is similar to other studies, except where samples are highly aligned or deformation is highly localized.

\subsection{Flow Law Fit Methodology} \label{CH2s_flowlawfit}
    A low temperature plasticity flow law was fit to stress vs. log(strainrate) using a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC-NUTS) optimizer due to the small local discontinuities in the fit. Results with errors are presented in Table \ref{tab:CH2s_FitTable} and distributions of the posterior are plotted in figure S\ref{fig:CH2s_KDE_plot}.

    Low stress data have a larger influence on the extrapolated fit because they define the transition between stress and temperature activation dominated regions of the Peierls law. The start of this transition can be seen in the slight curvature of the fit around points at 480°C in figure \ref{fig:CH2_Mechanical_combo}. In the flow law, the region is defined by exponents p, q, and normalization factor $\tau_p$.
    Changes in the curvature have a very large effect on extrapolated certainty of extrapolated viscosity. In this case feasible extrapolated viscosity decreases by several orders of magnitude when data at low stress is added to the fit (figure S\ref{fig:CH2s_Fitcompare-moredata}), and best fit confidence intervals shrink by an order of magnitude (figure \ref{fig:CH2_Mechanical_combo}).

\subsection{Griggs Rig Friction/Accuracy Measurement} \label{CH2s_frictiontesting}

    Several tests were completed to compare the new carbide bushing seal to the old mitre ring seal. We first deformed 360 grade brass rod, cut to simulate samples and confined by paraffin wax. The assembly was externally heated using hot water (same method as low temperature metal assembly), and repeatedly "hit" at different temperatures. (Figure \ref{fig:CH2s_Brass-Wax}) 
    We found that the squeezing force measured during “run-in”/"hit"  roughly follows predictions for “squeeze flow” rheometry. When the viscosity of the squeezed fluid decreases (in this case by heating the wax), the force for a given piston separation decreases.
    There is also a hysteresis with piston direction that does not vary significantly with temperature or distance between the sample and advancing piston. This appears to be primarily bearing friction applied by the packing ring. When we change to the carbide bushing, the size of the hysteresis loop decreases by a factor of 5x.
    Finally, rate dependence was explored with steps in the nearly fluid confining wax. Rate changes have a smaller effect with the carbide bushing (~2 MPa/10x strain rate), and do not have the small displacement dependent stress peaks the older mitre ring induces.
    
    To further test the ability to match the results of high temperature assemblies to room temperature assemblies, we loaded fused silica at 700°C in a standard, mitre-ring assembly and in a hydraulically confined assembly at low pressure (Figure \ref{fig:CH2s_WC-FS_elastic}). The results compare well, with the elastic modulus of the fused silica at high temperature matching the elastic modulus at low temperature. This indicates that we can compare all assemblies used in this study to each other and older results at similar conditions.

Assemblies have no furnace, and all confining media is paraffin wax. Samples were first pressurized to 300 MPa. Then the piston was advanced towards the sample, retracted, heated, and advanced again repeatedly. Retraction is plotted as thin dotted lines. Hysteresis between advancing and advancing stresses is a measure of seal friction (30 MPa new carbide, 140 MPa old packing ring). Rate steps were completed while retracting far from the sample to measure rate dependent friction.
