\subsection{Temperature Sweep Displacement Tracking}
        With the same components, a laser die temperature sweep can change wavelength by more than a nanometer to cross several fringes of the Fabry-Perot cavity. The approach is slow, requiring 8 seconds for a single wavelength scan cycle, but it allows calculation of the absolute cavity length. Figure \ref{fig:CH4s_TempScan} shows scans at 10 MPa and 50 MPa. Fringe spacing changes slightly, by a factor of $\Delta\sigma/E$. The position of the fringes, or alternatively the wavelength spectra of the cavity, is recorded over time and displayed in Figure \ref{fig:CH4s_TemperatureScans_wloading}, along with the modelplots of equation \ref{eq:CH4_e1} considering displacement on the loaded 10 mm alumina elastic element and temperature dependent wavelength.

\end{figure}    



\subsection{Vibrometer Modifications}
    A vibrometer can easily be incorporated into the design of the interferometer if optocouplers and another leg (e.g. fiber) are added to mix returning light with the incident, modulated signal. The sensor face needs and anti-reflective coating to avoid Fabry-Perot effects. I-Q demodulation can be used to track the position of the reflector to higher speeds.

    High temperature deformation in a Griggs-type apparatus is a challenging environment, with sample temperatures up to 1200°C less than 2 cm from the exterior of the pressure vessel. Existing pressure vessel and assembly design choices are mostly a legacy from eras when numerical modeling was inaccessible, which has made some thermal problems intractable to solve.
    To insert the ferrule ~1 cm from the hot sample requires adequate water cooling close to the sample to keep temperatures below fiber epoxy temperature limits of 100°C. Adding cooling tubes/channels sacrifices metal required to support the sample and pressure vessel. To explore the design space we developed a 2D axisymmetric thermal model published in Moarefvand et al (2021), and modified it to include a 'baseplate' supporting the pressure vessel, with heat transfer coefficient boundary conditions to water representing our actual cooling conditions rather than the simplified fixed temperature commonly used.
    We find that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Assembly material thermal conductivity (inside the pressure vessel) has a large effect on required power, and governs pressure vessel inner wall temperature. Changing from sodium chloride to potassium bromide confining media would decrease thermal conductivity by a factor of two and reduce vessel temperatures from 180°C to 100°C at 700°C sample temperatures.
        \item Current water cooling is inadequate below the pressure vessel. While water channels on top of the pressure vessel have a 1" ID and 3" OD with a 1/4" height, cooling in the baseplate is provided by a single 1/8"ID, 1/4" OD copper tube. This leads to high temperatures extending below the sample, with the baseplate reaching ~160°C at 700°C sample temperatures.
        \item Current materials conduct along the central axis (tungsten carbide), and insulate near the pressure vessel walls (pyrophyllite) where the water cooling is placed (see model). This leads to heat flowing downward into the baseplate, and then outward towards water cooling which further increases temperatures in the base carbide where the ferrule is placed. This can be swapped, putting steel near the vessel, and using a central pillar of zirconia or alumina (Figure \ref{fig:CH4s_ThermalModel1}. Several european groups modified their assemblies to this design \citep{rybacki1998servohydraulically} but do not note this benefit.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    In addition to the planned changes to the salt used for confining media and changes to the lower insulating material, we redesigned a baseplate to incorporate large water channels and a high conductivity beryllium copper support core (Figure \ref{fig:CH4s_NewBaseplate_Section}, \ref{fig:CH4s_NewBaseplate_Section_orth}). We took the opportunity to add an axisymmetric cavity at the bottom of the support post to incorporate acoustic emission sensors.
